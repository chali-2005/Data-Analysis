# Gold Price Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on gold price data using Python. 
Statistical measures and visualizations are used to understand data distribution, variability, and correlations.

## Key Features
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, skewness)
- Distribution analysis using histogram and QQ plot
- Correlation analysis with heatmap
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly (Treemap & Bubble Chart)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Plotly
  
## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with EDA techniques
- Statistical analysis of real-world data
- Data visualization using Python libraries
